# Version Control System

## Introduction

This project is a showcase of how version control systems are utilized in software development within a team without having difficulties. A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that tracks and manages changes to files and projects over time, allowing developers to collaborate, maintain code integrity, and easily rollback to previous versions. It essentially provides a history of all changes made to a project, enabling developers to revert to earlier states or compare different versions. 

## Project Basics
This project aims to illustrate the challenges of managing changes without version control. Through the process of manually copying and maintaining versions of a simple text file.

### GitHub User Dashboard

I used the git and github as my version control system.

### Git Status

This command `git status` is used to know the current status of your repository.

### Git Add and Git Commit

The `git add` command is used to stage the changes you want to include to your local ripo and the `git commit` command command is used to save changes to the local repository in Git.

### Git Push

After committing, the changes are still only available on your local repository. To make them accessible to others, you need to push the changes to a remote repository using the `git push` command.
