# Version Control System

## Introduction

This project is a showcase of how version control systems are utilised in software development within a team without having difficulties. A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that tracks and manages changes to files and projects over time, allowing developers to collaborate, maintain code integrity, and easily rollback to previous versions. It essentially provides a history of all changes made to a project, enabling developers to revert to earlier states or compare different versions.
